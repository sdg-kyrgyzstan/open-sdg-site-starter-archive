This Handbook provides metadata of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators of the Kyrgyz Republic disseminated through the National Reporting Platform.

NSC and other producers of official statistics constantly work to improve calculation methods for indicators and intend to include them in NRP when developing new indicators. Handbook electronic version will be regularly updated.

This Handbook has been written by the NSC in cooperation with other data producers involved in the process of SDG indicators preparation and technical assistance from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD).
